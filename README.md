**Contributions:**    
     Jonathan Jay:           Created test Unity program, prepared model in slicer, created technical drawings and exploded view animation, QFD and SUS Analysis, and constructed controller.           
     Matthew McPherson:    Catalogued all information about the controllers develeopment, created pitch presentation, constructed controller, wrote report, and general support and design advice.   
     Léo Buono:            3D printed model, programmed micro controller, wrote literature review, soltered and constructed controller.  
       

**Progression:**   
Final iteration has been created, 3D printed and constructed.

**Contributions:**    
     Jonathan Jay:           Created test Unity program, prepared model in slicer and constructed controller.           
     Matthew McPherson:    Catalogued all information about the controllers develeopment, created pressentation focusing on iteration, and general support and design advice.   
         (would have helped with construction but was unable to due to the Go Bus strike making commuting to campus impossible).    
     Léo Buono:            3D printed model, programmed micro controller and constructed controller.      
 
 **Progression:**   
First 3D print has been created and most functions have been programmed and wired.    
Print Details:  
Grip Print: ~6 hours; 39g blue PLA  
Everything else: (printed with a raft) ~6 hours; 42g green PLA

**In the Assignment 3 folder you will find:**  
- Images of our 3D print and electronic components  
- Video folder containing Slicer animations and youtube links to said animations  
- A folder containing the 3D print files  
- A folder containing our interactive scene, which is also playable on the github pages (readme there for more details)

Contributions:  
     Jonathan Jay:        CAD model, Electronic Schematics  
     Matthew McPherson:   Electronic Schematics, Components List, GrabCAD model search  
     Léo Buono:           Electronic Schematics, Components List, GrabCAD model search  
     
Progress:  
     The project has completed CAD models and is ready to begin physical prototyping via 3D printing. In addition, the project is also entering the phase where we are programming the microcontroller and using breadboard to test components.

In the Assignment 2 folder, you will find:  
-The step file for our controller  
-The technical drawings for our controller and each components  
-A folder called "Schematics" containing our circuit schematics  
-A folder called "Components list" containing a pdf of our component list for electronics  

Notes:  
While creating the exploded view, we ran into issues because we were using Sub-assemblies, and those don't count as extra components and we don't know how to make them do so. This led to us having to un-subassembly all our components which broke our exploding animation. We also found out that all our components' positions are baked into them, which means the technical drawings are not at the correct angle, we didn't know how to fix it so left it as it.
