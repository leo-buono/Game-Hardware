Progression:  
     The project has completed CAD models and is ready to begin physical prototyping via 3D printing. In addition, the project is also entering the phase where we are programming the microcontroller and using breadboard to test components.

In the Assignment 2 folder, you will find:  
-The step file for our controller  
-The technical drawings for our controller and each components  
-A folder called "Schematics" containing our circuit schematics  
-A folder called "Components list" containing a pdf of our component list for electronics  

Notes:  
While creating the exploded view, we ran into issues because we were using Sub-assemblies, and those don't count as extra components and we don't know how to make them do so. This led to us having to un-subassembly all our components which broke our exploding animation. We also found out that all our components' positions are baked into them, which means the technical drawings are not at the correct angle, we didn't know how to fix it so left it as it.
