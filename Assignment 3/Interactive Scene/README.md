This Interactive scene is for the purpose of showcasing the functionality of our one handed controller.  
Added through github pages: https://leo-buono.github.io/Game-Hardware/  

In this scene you take control of a character who can move, jump and shoot.  
The goal is to jump from platform to platform without falling and loop around the path. There's also some black boxes along the way that you can use to practice shooting (not required).  
  
Win Condition: make it to the top of the structure.  
Lose condition: fall of the ledge, leads to restart.  
  
Controls:  
Left Stick/WASD - move    
Right Stick/Mouse - aim/move camera    
Left Trigger/Right Mouse - aim mode  
Right Trigger/Left Mouse - shoot  
A/Space - jump
